# Javascript Quiz!
---
Inside the master branch I have all the code from the index file, css and javascript to the index, alongside the following pages for the quiz portion and the leaderboards. 
---
I kep messing up when I tried to make the local storage for the leaderboard and showing the scores. It kept just not showing and after a lot of trouble shooting and relooking over my code I realized I forgot to change back something after testing other stuff out.

The quiz is responsive and has correct answers alongside the wrong ones and wont score you if you pick the wrong ones.
---
The leaderboard is responsive and shows the top 5 scores that you got, pushing down the others and updating as scores get higher.
